# Project Tracker/ Plan file

A plan file in the style of John Carmack's .plan files from the Quake days.
I use this because being able to do my project tracking in a text file instead of using a mouse is easier for me.
Legend:

|    Prefix     |    Meaning    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| No prefix  | mentioned but not fixed or implemented  |
| *  | completed on that day  |
| +   | completed on a later day  |
| -   | decided against on a later day  |
